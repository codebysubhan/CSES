try1:
we cannot use unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int> because it will need a custom hash function for it as below:

struct pair_hash {
    size_t operator()(const pair<int, int>& p) const {
        return hash<int>()(p.first) ^ (hash<int>()(p.second) << 1);
    }
};

it didn't work :) so it's better to use map<pair<int, int>, int> and 2D arrays.

try2:
we can't use map<> due to slower lookups O(logn) so the most convenient option is to use 2D arrays.
